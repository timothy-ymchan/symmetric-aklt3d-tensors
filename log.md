## 4/28 
- I have finally figured out how to use CG coefficients to project to symmetric subspace
- The previous idea of rescaling the coefficients such that things works does not work out
- I believe the best way to project to symmetric subspace is to use CG coefficients directly
- But I don't know why one component of the CG coefficient is zero
- But if I use the one that is non-zero, I will get the correct tensor (See the end of the delta tensor notebook) 
- Similar construction in `aklt3d_delta_tensor.ipynb` should give the delta tensor with 3 X attached, but I have spent too much time on this little project, so I did not proceed 
- ZZ tensor construction and how to 2 legs into 1 is explored in the ZZ tensor notebook
